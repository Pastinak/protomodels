  * Memory consumption can be quite high, especially in multi-core mode.
    (There is no memory sharing between the processes).
	* If the database is rebuilt (e.g. because the content of the text database 
		has been changed), the interpolations of the upper limits can vary
 	 by tiny amounts depending on a machine's specific CPU. As a consequence,
	  the final results may differ slightly.
