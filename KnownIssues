Known Issues, v1.1.3
=======================================================

 * Interpolation of experimental results gives slightly different results
   when using older versions of lapack (called by scipy).
 * Signal uncertainties are considered when computing the upper limit
   for the best signal region, but not for the combined one
 * Distinct database pickle files are required for python2 and python3
