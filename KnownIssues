Known Issues, v1.1.0, ....
=======================================================

  * Memory consumption can be quite high, especially in multi-core mode.
    (There is no memory sharing between the processes). 
	  We intend to improve this in v1.2.

	* If the database is rebuilt (e.g. because the content of the text database 
		has been changed), the interpolations of the upper limits can vary
 	 by tiny amounts depending on a machine's specific CPU. As a consequence,
	  the final results may differ slightly.
	  We intend to make the code fully machine-independent in v1.2.

	* For simplified models with more than two model parameters sometimes 
	  we have results only for a lower dimensional hyperplane in the higher dimensional
	  model. In this case we allow for very small extrapolations. An example would
	  be associate squark-gluino production. It may be that we have a result only
	  for m(squark) == m(gluino). In that case we extrapolate and report results
	  also for m(squark) == m(gluino) +- epsilon. When, on the other hand upper limits are
	  defined for a second "plane" in model space (say, for m(squark) = 0.5 m(gluino) ),
	  then we interpolate between the two planes, but we do not extrapolate anymore.
	  Though this behavior is not "wrong" (we are just conservative), 
	  it introduces a small inconsistency with how we allow for tiny extrapolations. 
	  We intend to make things more consistent in v1.2.
