Some Basic Info about the development stage of the new Browser and database
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The new smodels.experiment folder assumes the following data structure in sms.py:


sms.py:
Dict['TChiWZ']= [  [[massList1,massList2],UL],  [[massList1,massList2],UL], [[massList1,massList2],UL]...]
...

where [massList1,massList2] = massArray for the whole element (massList1 = masses for Branch1, massList2 = masses for Branch2)

*Right now Example.py and the smodels.theory folder is being adapted to the new format. But since we do not have the new database in place,
it can not be tested.

*The code for dealing with summary plots and validation is not developed at all.
