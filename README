SModelS is based on a general procedure to decompose Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) collider signatures presenting a Z2 symmetry into Simplified Model Spectrum (SMS) topologies. Our method provides a way to cast BSM predictions for the LHC in a model independent framework, which can be directly confronted with the relevant experimental constraints. Our concrete implementation currently focusses on supersymmetry searches with missing energy, for which a large variety of SMS results from ATLAS and CMS are available. The main ingredients are:                                                        
 - the decomposition of the BSM spectrum into SMS topologies                          
 - a database of experimental SMS results                                             
 - the interface between decomposition and results database (to check limits)
