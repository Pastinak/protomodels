Additional SModelS Utilities
============================

The SModelS team entertains a repository with utilities around the SModelS
framework:

http://smodels.hephy.at/gitweb/?p=smodels-utils.git;a=summary

In this package one finds:

 * a plotting tool to plot feynman graphs from an SMS topology,
 * the tools the SModelS team uses to validate SModelS,
 * several tools that evaluate the status of the database,
 * tools that created all the plots visible at  http://www.hephy.at/online/pmssm.py,
 * a tool to produce a list of citations of the experimental results, in BibTeX,
 * and a few more.

Note that these utilities, while useful for use, may be of limited use only to you:
Your mileage may vary. You have been warned.
